#### Educational Content Framework
**Replace Promotional Copy With:**
```
WHAT: Tesla Wellness Technology Explained

The Tesla Wellness Table creates a unique healing environment using principles discovered by Nikola Tesla. This technology generates multiple energy vectors that work together to support your body's natural healing systems.

HOW: The Science Behind the Experience

The table uses a Tesla coil supported by a 12-pointed star configuration, six noble gas plasma tubes, programmable frequencies, and LED chromotherapy. These components create a toroidal energy field that encourages your nervous system to shift into a parasympathetic state—the body's natural healing mode.

WHY: Supporting Your Wellness Journey

Users report feeling more balanced, relaxed, and energized. The technology is designed to complement your body's innate healing abilities, not replace medical treatment. Each session is customized using kinesiology and frequency selection based on your individual needs.

DRIVE CONTEXT: Adding Tesla Quantum to Your Wellness Protocol
Consider Tesla sessions as part of a comprehensive wellness approach. Many clients combine Tesla table sessions with RoXiva light therapy for enhanced results. Sessions typically last 20-60 minutes and can be scheduled as single visits or package series.
