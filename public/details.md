Welcome to The Healing Frequency Space, a sanctuary for advanced wellness technologies designed to support your journey toward authentic healing and self-renewal.
Tesla Quantum Table Sessions
At The Healing Frequency Space, I am proud to offer sessions with the Tesla Quantum Table. This unique table is inspired by the groundbreaking work of Nikola Tesla and integrates advanced technologies to create a deeply restorative environment for your body and mind.
Each session is customized to your individual needs, using a blend of intuitive kinesiology and frequency selection . The Tesla Quantum Table features:
A Tesla coil supported by a 12-pointed star for optimal energy flow and temperature regulation
Six noble gas-filled lightbulbs emitting plasma energy
A programmable frequency monitor for custom settings, including homeopathic remedy imprinting
A vibrant LED array for chromotherapy (color therapy) treatments79
During your time on the Tesla Quantum Table, multiple energy vectors—including pulsed electromagnetic frequencies, plasma, sound, and light—work synergistically to create a healing energy field around your body. This environment is designed to help restore your body’s natural electromagnetic balance, encouraging a shift into a parasympathetic (rest and digest) state, which is essential for deep healing and regeneration79.
Reported Benefits from Tesla Table Users:
Enhanced relaxation and stress reduction
Relief from pain and inflammation
Improved cellular communication and energy
Boosted immune system function
Balanced energy centers and meridians
Increased metabolism and improved digestion
Heightened sense of wellbeing and life force
Support for recovery and rejuvenation, including accelerated wound healing and enhanced cancer recovery
Anti-aging effects and improved focus179
Many users describe feeling more balanced, energized, and calm after sessions, with some reporting remarkable improvements in their health over time. Please note: these are personal experiences and not medical claims. The Tesla Quantum Table is not a treatment or cure, but a supportive modality to facilitate your body’s inherent healing abilities.

Mission:To guide you toward authentic healing, empowering you to become your best future self. Every session is tailored to your unique needs, supporting your body’s intuitive capacity for self-healing.

RoXiva Stroboscopic Light Sessions
In addition to the Tesla Table, The Healing Frequency Space offers transformative experiences with the RoXiva stroboscopic lamp. This innovative technology uses synchronized flickering white light and sound to guide your brain into meditative, trance, or psychedelic states—completely drug-free3468.
RoXiva sessions are carefully choreographed, often in collaboration with artists and neuroscientists, to create immersive journeys filled with vivid colors, kaleidoscopic shapes, and profound sensory experiences. The flickering light stimulates the optic nerve and influences brainwave activity, helping you access deep relaxation, heightened creativity, and states of joy and wonder48.
Benefits of RoXiva Sessions:
Quick access to deep meditation or trance states
Elevated mood and increased serotonin levels
Enhanced relaxation and stress relief
Drug-free psychedelic experiences and personal insight
Support for those managing depression, anxiety, or in recovery programs
A safe, controlled way to experience altered states of consciousness—whether for five minutes or a full session468
RoXiva is ideal for anyone seeking a mood boost, a creative escape, or a safe, non-pharmaceutical approach to exploring the mind. Each session is tailored to your comfort and goals, offering a unique and uplifting experience every time.

Disclaimer:Neither the Tesla Quantum Table nor RoXiva sessions are intended to diagnose, treat, or cure any medical condition. Experiences and benefits are based on user reports and individual results may vary. Sessions are designed to complement your wellness journey and support your body’s natural healing processes.
Combining Tesla Quantum Table sessions with RoXiva stroboscopic light therapy has the potential to significantly enhance your overall sense of well-being by addressing both physical and mental dimensions of health in a synergistic way.
Tesla Quantum Table sessions focus on restoring the body’s energetic balance, supporting cellular communication, reducing inflammation, boosting the immune system, and promoting deep relaxation. Users often report feeling more balanced, energized, and calm, with improvements in pain relief, emotional clarity, and overall vitality.
RoXiva Light Therapy works through brainwave and audio-visual entrainment, using stroboscopic light and sound patterns to guide the brain into desired states—ranging from deep relaxation to heightened focus or even psychedelic-like experiences. Reported benefits include stress reduction, improved sleep, elevated mood, enhanced creativity, and greater mental clarity124. RoXiva also helps release old thought patterns, reset the nervous system, and foster emotional balance34.
Synergistic Benefits of Combining Both Modalities
Deeper Relaxation and Stress Relief: Tesla sessions bring the body into a parasympathetic state, while RoXiva’s brainwave entrainment deepens mental relaxation and helps release stress at the neurological level14.
Enhanced Emotional Balance: The Tesla Table supports energetic and emotional clearing, while RoXiva sessions can help break habitual low moods and foster long-term positivity and resilience13.
Boosted Creativity and Clarity: Tesla therapy restores energetic flow, and RoXiva’s light and sound patterns stimulate brainwaves linked to creativity, insight, and cognitive enhancement24.
Improved Sleep and Recovery: Both modalities support restorative states—Tesla through physical relaxation and RoXiva by entraining delta and theta brainwaves associated with deep sleep and cellular repair4.
Holistic Mind-Body Integration: The combination engages multiple senses and systems, fostering a harmonious mind-body connection, which can accelerate personal transformation and well-being4.

Ryan, we can incorporate something like this, somewhere on the website
Many wellness centers recommend pairing light therapy with other bioenergetic modalities for a more profound experience, as the multisensory stimulation can amplify relaxation, clarity, and healing outcomes.
 By integrating Tesla Quantum Table sessions with RoXiva, you are likely to experience a more comprehensive sense of balance, rejuvenation, and inner harmony—supporting both your physical and mental wellness goals.
