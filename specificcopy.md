Welcome to The Healing Frequency Space, a sanctuary for advanced wellness technologies designed to support your journey toward authentic healing and self-renewal.
Tesla Wellness Table Sessions
At The Healing Frequency Space, I am proud to offer sessions with the Tesla Wellness Table, invented by Paul Esch—a pioneer in the field of bioenergetic healing devices2. This unique table is inspired by the groundbreaking work of Nikola Tesla and integrates advanced technologies to create a deeply restorative environment for your body and mind.
Each session is customized to your individual needs, using a blend of intuitive kinesiology and frequency selection guided by The Frequencies of Rifing guidebook. The Tesla Table features:
A Tesla coil supported by a 12-pointed star for optimal energy flow and temperature regulation
Six noble gas-filled lightbulbs emitting plasma energy
A programmable frequency monitor for custom settings, including homeopathic remedy imprinting
A vibrant LED array for chromotherapy (color therapy) treatments79
During your time on the Tesla Wellness Table, multiple energy vectors—including pulsed electromagnetic frequencies, plasma, sound, and light—work synergistically to create a toroidal energy field around your body. This environment is designed to help restore your body’s natural electromagnetic balance, encouraging a shift into a parasympathetic (rest and digest) state, which is essential for deep healing and regeneration79.
Reported Benefits from Tesla Table Users:
Enhanced relaxation and stress reduction
Relief from pain and inflammation

Yes, the concept of a torus or toroidal field is directly related to both the Tesla Wellness Table and Tesla generator technologies.
Tesla Wellness Table:
The Tesla Wellness Table uses a Tesla coil to generate pulsed electromagnetic fields (PEMF) in a toroidal (doughnut-shaped) field around the body. This toroidal field is central to how the device operates, aiming to restore the body’s electromagnetic balance and promote homeostasis. The table creates a concentrated electromagnetic plasma field, with energy circulating in a torus pattern, amplifying the body’s natural healing processes. The combination of PEMF, plasma energy, Rife frequencies, sound, and light all rotate within this toroidal field, with a zero-energy point at the center—mirroring the classic torus energy flow seen in nature and in Tesla’s own electromagnetic experiments1234.
Tesla Generator:
While "Tesla generator" is a broad term, it often refers to devices inspired by Nikola Tesla’s work on wireless energy transmission and electromagnetic resonance. Tesla’s inventions, such as the Tesla coil, generate high-voltage, high-frequency electromagnetic fields that naturally form toroidal patterns. The toroidal field is not just a theoretical construct; it’s a practical feature of how these electromagnetic devices operate, allowing for efficient energy transfer and, in some interpretations, the amplification of energy via resonance and feedback loops5678.
Scalar and Bioenergetic Devices:
Modern Tesla-inspired wellness technologies, such as the TeslaTorus and Tesla Grounding devices, also utilize toroidal and scalar fields. These devices are designed to harmonize the body's biofield by emitting subtle electromagnetic or scalar waves in a torus shape, supporting energy balance and grounding91011.
Summary Table: Relationship of Torus Fields to Tesla Devices
Device/Concept Torus/Toroidal Field Role Purpose/Effect
Tesla Wellness Table Generates PEMF in a toroidal field around the body Restores EM balance, amplifies healing, induces calm
Tesla Generator/Coil Produces high-frequency toroidal electromagnetic fields Wireless energy transfer, resonance, energy feedback
TeslaTorus, Tesla Grounding Emits toroidal/scalar fields to harmonize biofield Grounding, EMF protection, energy balance
In essence:
The torus or toroidal field is not just a visual metaphor but a fundamental principle in both the operation and philosophy of Tesla-inspired wellness and energy devices. These fields are believed to mirror natural energy flows in the body and universe, and their application in Tesla tables and generators is rooted in Tesla’s original insights into energy, frequency, and vibration1359.
