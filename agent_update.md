1. Executive Summary & Workflow Objectives

Workflow Model: This workflow is designed as a modular, linear process with a built-in feedback loop during the confirmation phase to allow for iterations on the todo list based on review findings. It emphasizes agent-centric assignments, incorporating review stages for quality assurance and efficiency through task automation where possible (e.g., scripted content updates).
Primary Goals: 1. Produce an organized todo.md file compiling all specified website updates for clear execution. 2. Confirm and refine the update list to ensure alignment with an informational tone and task requirements. 3. Implement and deploy the updates to achieve a revised website that is informational, with all specified removals, additions, and changes applied.
Core Principle Focus: Agent-Centric Design (leveraging documented specializations for optimal assignments), Modularity & Non-Linearity (phased structure with confirmation feedback loop), Efficiency & Automation (automating content pulls and updates via frontend scripting where feasible).

2. Critical Path Analysis

Task Dependencies: Website review must precede todo.md creation to contextualize updates; todo.md creation precedes confirmation to provide a basis for review; confirmation precedes implementation to finalize the scope; implementation precedes deployment to ensure changes are ready for launch.
Critical Path: The critical path for this workflow is: Website Review -> Todo.md Creation -> Confirmation and Refinement -> Implementation of Updates -> Testing and Deployment. Delays in these specific activities will directly impact the overall timeline.

3. Phased Workflow Execution Plan
   Phase 1: Website Review and Todo Compilation

Objective: Analyze the current website structure and content to inform the compilation of provided updates into a structured todo.md file, ensuring all changes are contextualized.
Step 1.1: Conduct a thorough review of the website's current state, identifying elements like hero sections, testimonials, pricing, and tone for alignment with updates.

Primary Agent: ux-researcher
Collaborating Agent(s): studio-producer
Justification: The documentation states this agent specializes in analyzing user behavior and identifying friction points, which is essential for reviewing site elements like inconsistent headers, tone, and content placement to provide context for updates.

Step 1.2: Compile the provided list of updates into a todo.md file, organizing them into categorized tasks (e.g., removals, additions, changes).

Primary Agent: sprint-prioritizer
Collaborating Agent(s): ux-researcher
Justification: The documentation indicates this agent handles task prioritization and organization, making it ideal for structuring the raw update list into a actionable todo.md with logical grouping and sequencing.

Phase 2: Confirmation and Refinement

Objective: Review the compiled todo.md for accuracy, feasibility, and alignment with the informational tone, incorporating feedback loops for any necessary adjustments.
Step 2.1: Present the todo.md for confirmation, gather input on priorities or clarifications, and iterate if needed (e.g., via a feedback loop back to Phase 1 if major discrepancies are found).

Primary Agent: studio-producer
Collaborating Agent(s): sprint-prioritizer, ux-researcher
Justification: The documentation positions this agent as the overseer of production workflows, responsible for coordinating reviews and ensuring alignment, which is critical for confirming the todo list before execution.

Phase 3: Implementation of Updates

Objective: Execute the confirmed todo.md tasks by making specific content, design, and structural changes to the website.
Step 3.1: Apply changes such as removing elements (e.g., prices, stats), adding content (e.g., Victoria's bio, new sections), and adjusting tone/layout (e.g., hero image, testimonials).

Primary Agent: frontend-developer
Collaborating Agent(s): studio-producer
Justification: The documentation specifies this agent excels in implementing frontend modifications, including HTML/CSS updates for removals, additions, and layout shifts, directly suiting the task's content and design changes.

Step 3.2: Test the implemented changes for functionality (e.g., static header behavior) and informational tone consistency.

Primary Agent: frontend-developer
Collaborating Agent(s): ux-researcher
Justification: The documentation highlights this agent's role in building and testing frontend elements, with collaboration from the ux-researcher to validate user-facing improvements like friction reduction.

Phase 4: Deployment and Final Review

Objective: Deploy the updated website and perform a post-deployment check to ensure all updates are live and functioning as intended.
Step 4.1: Ship the changes to production and verify the live site.

Primary Agent: project-shipper
Collaborating Agent(s): frontend-developer, studio-producer
Justification: The documentation defines this agent as responsible for final deployment and launch processes, ensuring seamless rollout after implementation.
