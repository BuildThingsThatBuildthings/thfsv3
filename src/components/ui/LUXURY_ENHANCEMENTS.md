  {/* Content with parallax effect */}
</LuxuryParallax>
```

#### `LuxuryFocus`
**Purpose**: Sophisticated focus management with quantum styling
- Distinguishes between keyboard and mouse focus
- Animated quantum particle rings around focused elements
- Accessibility-compliant with WCAG standards
- Multiple color themes: quantum, flow, sage

**Usage**:
```tsx
<LuxuryFocus focusRingColor="flow">
  <Button>Focused Button</Button>
</LuxuryFocus>
```

#### `LuxuryLoading`
**Purpose**: Premium loading experiences with quantum animations
- Sophisticated toroidal field and energy particle system
- Elegant progress indicators with quantum aesthetics
- Customizable messages and sizing
- Breathing animation patterns

**Usage**:
```tsx
<LuxuryLoading 
  size="lg"
  message="Preparing your healing experience..."
/>
```

#### `LuxuryTooltip`
**Purpose**: Elegant tooltip system with quantum styling
- Intelligent positioning with viewport awareness
- Subtle quantum glow and particle effects
- Customizable delay and positioning
- Backdrop blur with luxury glass effects

**Usage**:
```tsx
<LuxuryTooltip content="Luxury tooltip content" position="top">
  <Button>Hover me</Button>
</LuxuryTooltip>
```

#### `LuxuryPageTransition`
**Purpose**: Smooth page transitions with quantum elements
- Elegant fade, scale, and blur transitions
- Central quantum orb during transition states
- Customizable timing and easing curves
- Accessibility-aware with reduced motion support

**Usage**:
```tsx
<LuxuryPageTransition>
  {/* Page content */}
</LuxuryPageTransition>
```

### Enhanced Existing Components

## Hooks System

### `useLuxuryInteractions`
**Purpose**: Comprehensive interaction tracking for luxury effects

**Features**:
- Cursor position tracking
- Scroll state monitoring (direction, velocity)
- Interaction intensity calculation
- Organic variation generation
- Accessibility-aware motion preferences

**Returns**:
```tsx
const {
  isHovering,
  cursorPosition,
  scrollState,
  prefersReducedMotion,
  handleMouseEnter,
  handleMouseLeave,
  getLuxuryVariation,
  getInteractionIntensity,
  shouldShowEffects,
  luxuryIntensity
} = useLuxuryInteractions();
```

## Design Philosophy

### Luxury Principles
1. **Sophisticated Restraint**: Effects enhance without overwhelming
2. **Organic Movement**: Natural, breathing animations vs mechanical
3. **Contextual Responsiveness**: Adapts to user interaction patterns
4. **Accessibility First**: Respects motion preferences and WCAG guidelines
5. **Quantum Metaphors**: Visual language that reinforces healing themes

### Color Palette Integration
- **Quantum Colors**: `quantum-forest`, `quantum-energy`, `quantum-gold`
- **Flow Palette**: `flow-400` through `flow-900` for energy effects
- **Sage Tones**: `sage-400` through `sage-700` for natural elements

### Animation Principles
- **Easing**: Custom curves `[0.25, 0.8, 0.25, 1]` for organic feel
- **Timing**: Varied durations (1.5s - 4s) to avoid mechanical feel
- **Staggering**: Delayed animations for sophisticated reveals
- **Breathing**: Subtle scale/opacity variations for living feel

## Implementation Guidelines

### Performance Considerations
- Uses `transform-gpu` for hardware acceleration
- Passive event listeners for scroll/mouse tracking
- Conditional rendering based on `prefers-reduced-motion`
- Optimized filter effects with minimal blur values

### Accessibility Features
- Full `prefers-reduced-motion` support
- Keyboard navigation with luxury focus indicators
- Screen reader friendly (no interfering animations)
- High contrast quantum color choices (WCAG AA compliant)

### Usage Patterns

#### Hero Section Enhancement
```tsx
<LuxuryCursor className="min-h-screen">
  <section className="relative min-h-screen">
    <LuxuryParallax intensity="subtle">
      {/* Quantum background elements */}
    </LuxuryParallax>
    
    <LuxuryParallax intensity="medium">
      <div className="content">
        <LuxuryFocus focusRingColor="flow">
          <Button variant="primary">Primary CTA</Button>
        </LuxuryFocus>
      </div>
    </LuxuryParallax>
  </section>
</LuxuryCursor>
```

#### Loading States
```tsx
// Simple loading
<Loading variant="luxury" size="md" text="Loading..." />

// Premium experience loading
<LuxuryLoading 
  size="lg" 
  message="Preparing your quantum healing experience..."
/>
```

#### Interactive Elements
```tsx
<LuxuryTooltip content="Schedule your transformation" position="top">
  <LuxuryFocus focusRingColor="quantum">
    <Button variant="primary">Book Session</Button>
  </LuxuryFocus>
</LuxuryTooltip>
```
